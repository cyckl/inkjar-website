At Inkjar, we're proud of our works. We work our blood, sweat, and tears into every commission, project, and every thing big and small in-between. Because of such, we have special guidelines for all of our works.

This site's code is licensed under the [3-Clause BSD license,](https://github.com/inkjar/inkjar.github.io/blob/main/LICENSE) and can be found [on our public GitHub.](https://github.com/inkjar/inkjar.github.io) We do this to help others learn from our hard work to craft their own portfolios and sites. Where not mentioned, assets like, but not limited to, icons, photos, and drawings follow an all rights reserved policy.

When we develop sites for others, we give them the choice to open-source their sites or to leave them closed. By default, we keep them closed-source with the only people with access being the person the site is for and, in the event that we are hosting the website, ourselves to build and maintain versions of the site for publishing.
